									<h4>National Observatory of Athens</h4>
									<p style=" text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.noa.gr/en/" target="_blank"><span class="image left"><img src='~/assets/images/institutions/noa.png' alt="" /></span></a>
                                        The National Observatory of Athens (NOA) is the oldest 
                                Greek public research centre (founded in 1842). It hosts the UNESCO Chair for Natural Disasters and operates the Greek GEO Office (Group on Earth Observations).
                                <br><br>
                                NOA’s Institute for Environmental Research & Sustainable Development (IERSD) maintains the longest and most complete climatologic record 
                                in Greece of meteorological (>120yrs) and solar radiation (>60yrs) parameters. It was also the first organisation that started a systematic 
                                study of urban pollution in Athens, in 1980. The Institute’s research orientation includes: meteorological monitoring (260 stations), 
                                experimental research on air quality, atmospheric chemistry, aerosols and solar radiation, climate change research, synoptic and mesoscale 
                                atmospheric modeling, applied research (buildings, indoor air pollution, energy conservation, consultant services, e.t.c.), environmental management, 
                                surface and underground hydrology.
                                <br><br>
                                The Institute for Astronomy, Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing (IAASARS) is one of the three institutes of the National 
                                Observatory of Athens, the oldest research institution in Greece. The main activities of the Institute involve basic and applied research 
                                in a number of topics in astrophysics, from distant galaxies to the solar neighbourhood, as well as ground based and space-borne remote sensing, 
                                earth observation and signal processing. The institute is also committed to outreach and science dissemination for the general public and operates 
                                a very popular visitor centre in Penteli.

									<h4>Cyprus Institute</h4>
									<p style=" text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.cyi.ac.cy/" target="_blank"><span class="image right"><img src='~/assets/images/institutions/cyprus.png' alt="" /></span></a>
                                        The Cyprus Institute (CyI) is a non-profit research and educational institution with a strong 
                                scientific and technological orientation. It is an issue oriented institution, emphasizing international collaborations and cross-disciplinary research and post 
                                graduate education. CyI is being developed by establishing research centres which address challenging problems that are important at both the regional and international 
                                levels. Its research centres are developed in partnership with leading institutions in the respective thematic areas. The Energy, Environment and Water Research Centre 
                                (EEWRC) is one the 3 research centres of CyI and currently involved in ACTRIS-2 and participating to ACTRIS PPP.

                                EEWRC works in close collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany, the Cyprus 
                                Research Promotion Foundation (RPF), and many national institutions and organizations in Cyprus and the region on societally relevant issues related to Energy and 
                                Renewables, Environment and Climate, and Water and Natural Resources. Over the past few years, EEWRC has proven to be a leader in the area of Environmental and Climate 
                                research. The Atmospheric and Climate Research in particular, in close co-operation with the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry (MPIC) in Mainz, Germany, has established 
                                CyI as a key player of Climate Research in the region and beyond. In particular, EEWRC has been instrumental in providing evidence that the Eastern Mediterranean and 
                                Middle East region (EMME) is a climate change “hotspot” and relating this to public health, ecosystem development and water, to name but a few of the impact sectors 
                                considered. These studies have attained international recognition, notably for their emphasis on the EMME. The research has been nationally embedded through strong 
                                collaborations with the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment, and the Ministry of Energy, Commerce, Industry and Tourism.

										<h4>European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts</h4>
										<p style=" text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.ecmwf.int" target="_blank"><span class="image left"><img src='~/assets/images/institutions/ecmwf.png' alt="" /></span></a>
											The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is an independent intergovernmental organisation supported by 34 states.
			
											ECMWF is both a research institute and a 24/7 operational service, producing and disseminating numerical weather predictions to its Member States. 
											This data is fully available to the national meteorological services in the Member States. The Centre also offers a catalogue of forecast data that 
											can be purchased by businesses worldwide and other commercial customers. The supercomputer facility (and associated data archive) at ECMWF is one of 
											the largest of its type in Europe and Member States can use 25% of its capacity for their own purposes.
											<br>
											The organisation was established in 1975 and now employs around 360 staff from more than 30 countries. ECMWF is one of the six members of the 
											Co-ordinated Organisations, which also include the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), the Council of Europe (CoE), the European Space 
											Agency (ESA), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological 
											Satellites (EUMETSAT).
											<br><br>
											ECMWF is based in Reading, UK.
